# Style Guide 

- We accept original and unpublished blogs only.
- Best Practices
  - Each blog should have around 5+ minutes of read time.
  - Format the blogs for consistency.

## Best Practices

- Check the Grammar and spellings. Use "Languagetool" or similar tools.
- Multiple lines of code should be in a code block.
- Use **bold** when needed and try to avoid *italics*.
- Space after "." and "," is a must.

- Use Images, Screenshots, diagrams wherever it makes sense to use them.
- Readers should be able to copy code used in the blog, regardless of it being a simple shell command.
- "Credit the sources" if you use any.

- Avoid sharing screenshots, images or code that contains personal, private or any sensitive information.
- Use arrows, boxes, etc in the screenshots if it makes things easy for the reader to identify.

- Thumbnail/Cover images related to the blog content are better than just random images.
- Add **Tags**, and choose **Generate table of contents**.
