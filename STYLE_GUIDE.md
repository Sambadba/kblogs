# Blogs Style Guide

Welcome to the **Kubesimplify Blogs Style Guide**. We are here to help you write the best possible content for Kubesimplify and showcase your learnings!

Let us start with an important disclaimer: 
> **We accept original and unpublished blogs only!**

## Best Practices

Here are some **simple** but **very essential** best practices to keep in mind:

- Each blog should have around **5+ minutes** of read time.
- Format the blogs by using **proper headings**, for consistency.
- Check the Grammar and spellings. Use [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org/) or similar tools.
- Multiple lines of code should be in a code block.
    - For example:
        ```code_block
        package main
        import "fmt"

        func main() {
            fmt.Println("hello world")
        }
        ```
- Use **bold** when needed and **try to avoid** *italics*.
- Space after **"."** and **","** is a must.
- Use **Images**, **Screenshots**, **diagrams** wherever it makes sense to use them.
- Make sure that readers are able to **copy the code** used in the blog, regardless of it being a simple shell command.
- "**Credit the sources**" if you use any.
- Avoid sharing screenshots, images or code that contains personal, private or any sensitive information.
- Use **arrows**, **boxes**, etc in the screenshots if it makes things easy for the reader to identify.
- Creating a custom **Thumbnail/Cover** images related to the blog content are better than just random images.
- Add **Tags**, and choose **Generate table of contents** option **(provided by Hashnode)**.
